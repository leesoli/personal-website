        <p>Hi there! I'm Anna, a React front-end developer based in Tustin, California. I'm a self-taught developer with a keen eye for design and love to build simple, stylish interfaces on my free time. I'm inspired and motivated by anything that is food (including the first application I ever built!).
        </p>

        <p>I became interested in programming in 2021 during the pandemic. Previously, I worked as a Medic and Teamleader in the U.S. Army and was in search of a career where I would feel equally fulfilled and challenged. I fell in love with programming as it allowed me to apply my creative ability and problem-solving skills.
        </p>

        <p>After completing Scrimba Frontend Career Path, I am searching for a new challenge: to jumpstart my career in frontend development.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am working on building a social media app for foodies. On my free time, I like to go rock climb or go swimming.</p>
